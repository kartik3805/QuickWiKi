#  Contributing to QuickWiki

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features and UI/UX changes
- If you are beginner then you can contribute by improving the structure or the layout or any mistakes in the repository.


##  We Develop with Netlify

Our project is currently hosted on Netlify and you can visit it on [ quickwiki.netlify.app](https://quickwiki.netlify.app/)

  
  
##  We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow ](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
We actively welcome your pull requests,

1. Star this repository.
2. Create an issue with description and wait for approval.
3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
6. Ensure the test suite passes.
7. Make sure your code lints.
8. Issue that pull request!
